# Xquik REST API endpoints: tweet style cache

## Protect cached style data

Style creation, replacement, and deletion change persistent cached resources.
For analysis, show the username, estimated usage, and storage effect. For
custom saves, show the label, source tweets, and replacement effect. For
deletion, show the label or username and deletion effect. Proceed only after
explicit approval for that exact write.
Cached profiles and comparisons are account-scoped reads. Require exact-scope
approval before retrieving them.

### Analyze and cache style

`POST /styles`

Fetch recent tweets from an X account and cache them for style analysis. This call is metered.

Get approval first. Confirm the username, metered usage, and intent to store
the resulting profile before creating the cache.

Send this request body:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `username` | string | Yes | X username without `@` |

For a 201 response, the API returns:

```json
{
  "xUsername": "elonmusk",
  "tweetCount": 20,
  "isOwnAccount": false,
  "fetchedAt": "2026-02-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "tweets": [
    {
      "id": "1893456789012345678",

### List cached styles

entries. Show that scope, the purpose, recipients, and retention plan.

### Save custom style

`PUT /styles/{id}`

Save a custom style profile from tweet texts. The body `label` controls the saved style label and replaces any existing style with that label.

Get approval first. Preview the label and source texts. Warn when an existing
label will be replaced, then obtain explicit approval.

Send this body:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Yes | Style label from 1-30 characters |
| `tweets` | object[] | Yes | Array of 1-100 tweet objects; each needs a `text` field |

For a 200 response, the API returns a style object with its label, `tweetCount`, `isOwnAccount: false`, `fetchedAt`, and `tweets`.

Possible errors include `400 invalid_input`.
